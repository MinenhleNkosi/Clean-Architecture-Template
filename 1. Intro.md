# The WEB.
Internet (or The Web) is a massive distributed client/server information system as depicted in the following diagram.

Many applications are running concurrently over the Web, such as web browsing/surfing, e-mail, file transfer, audio & video streaming, and so on.  In order for proper communication to take place between the client and the server, these applications must agree on a specific application-level protocol such as `HTTP`, `FTP`, `SMTP`, `POP`, and etc.

## HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
HTTP (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**) is perhaps the most popular application protocol used in the Internet (or The WEB).
* **HTTP** is an *asymmetric* request-response client-server protocol as illustrated.  An HTTP client sends a request message to an HTTP server.  The server, in turn, returns a response message.  In other words, HTTP is a pull protocol, the client pulls information from the server (instead of server pushes information down to the client).

* HTTP is a stateless protocol. In other words, the current request does not know what has been done in the previous requests.
* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers.

## Browser.
Whenever you issue a URL from your browser to get a web resource using HTTP, e.g. http://www.nowhere123.com/index.html, the browser turns the URL into a request message and sends it to the HTTP server. The HTTP server interprets the request message, and returns you an appropriate response message, which is either the resource you requested or an error message. This process is illustrated below:

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to uniquely identify a resource over the web. URL has the following syntax:
`protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name`

There are four parts in a URL:
1. **Protocol:** The apllication-level protocol used by the client and server, e.g, HTTP, FTP, and telnet.
2. **Hostname:** The DNS domain name (e.g, www.nowhwere123.com) or IP address (e.g, 192.128.1.2) of the server.
3. **Port:** The TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from the clients.
4. **Path-and-file-name:** The name and location of the requested resource, under the server document base directory.

For example, in the URL `http://www.nowhere123.com/docs/index.html`, the communication **protocol** is **HTTP**; the **hostname** is **www.nowhere123.com**. The **port number** was not specified in the URL, and takes on the default number, which is **TCP port 80** for HTTP. The **path** and **file name** for the resource to be located is **"/docs/index.html"**.

Other examples of URL are:
```
ftp://www.ftp.org/docs/test.txt
mailto:user@test101.com
news:soc.culture.Singapore
telnet://www.nowhere123.com/
```
