# HTTP Protocol.
As mentioned, whenever you enter a URL in the address box of the browser, the browser translates the URL into a request message according to the specified protocol; and sends the request message to the server. 

For example, the browser translated the URL `http://www.nowhere123.com/docs/index.html` into the following request message:

```
GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.nowhere123.com
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
(blank line)
```
When this request message reaches the server, the server can take either one of these actions:
1. The server interprets the request received, maps the request into a file under the server's document directory, and returns the file requested to the client.
2. The server interprets the request received, maps the request into a program kept in the server, executes the program, and returns the output of the program to the client.
3. The request cannot be satisfied, the server returns an error message.

An example of the HTTP response message is as shown:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:56:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2004 07:16:26 GMT
ETag: "10000000565a5-2c-3e94b66c2e680"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 44
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
X-Pad: avoid browser bug
  
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
```
The browser receives the response message, interprets the message and displays the contents of the message on the browser's window according to the media type of the response (as in the Content-Type response header). Common media type include "text/plain", "text/html", "image/gif", "image/jpeg", "audio/mpeg", "video/mpeg", "application/msword", and "application/pdf".

In its idling state, an HTTP server does nothing but listening to the IP address(es) and port(s) specified in the configuration for incoming request. When a request arrives, the server analyzes the message header, applies rules specified in the configuration, and takes the appropriate action. The webmaster's main control over the action of web server is via the configuration, which will be dealt with in greater details in the later sections.

## HTTP over TCP/IP.
HTTP is a client-server application-level protocol. It typically runs over a TCP/IP connection, as illustrated. (HTTP needs not run on TCP/IP. It only presumes a reliable transport. Any transport protocols that provide such guarantees can be used.)

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of transport and network-layer protocols for machines to communicate with each other over the network.

IP (Internet Protocol) is a network-layer protocol, deals with network addressing and routing. In an IP network, each machine is assigned an unique IP address (e.g., 165.1.2.3), and the IP software is responsible for routing a message from the source IP to the destination IP. In IPv4 (IP version 4), the IP address consists of 4 bytes, each ranges from 0 to 255, separated by dots, which is called a quad-dotted form.  This numbering scheme supports up to 4G addresses on the network.  The latest IPv6 (IP version 6) supports more addresses.  Since memorizing number is difficult for most of the people, an english-like domain name, such as www.nowhere123.com is used instead.  The DNS (Domain Name Service) translates the domain name into the IP address (via distributed lookup tables). A special IP address 127.0.0.1 always refers to your own machine.  It's domian name is "localhost" and can be used for local loopback testing.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol, responsible for establish a connection between two machines. TCP consists of 2 protocols: TCP and UDP (User Datagram Package).  TCP is reliable, each packet has a sequence number, and an acknowledgement is expected.  A packet will be re-transmitted if it is not received by the receiver.  Packet delivery is guaranteed in TCP.  UDP does not guarantee packet delivery, and is therefore not reliable.  However, UDP has less network overhead and can be used for applications such as video and audio streaming, where reliability is not critical.

TCP multiplexes applications within an IP machine. For each IP machine, TCP supports (multiplexes) up to 65536 ports (or sockets), from port number 0 to 65535.  An application, such as HTTP or FTP, runs (or listens) at a particular port number for incoming requests. Port 0 to 1023 are pre-assigned to popular protocols, e.g., HTTP at 80, FTP at 21, Telnet at 23, SMTP at 25, NNTP at 119, and DNS at 53.  Port 1024 and above are available to the users.

Although TCP port 80 is pre-assigned to HTTP, as the default HTTP port number, this does not prohibit you from running an HTTP server at other user-assigned port number (1024-65535) such as 8000, 8080, especially for test server. You could also run multiple HTTP servers in the same machine on different port numbers. When a client issues a URL without explicitly stating the port number, e.g., `http://www.nowhere123.com/docs/index.html`, the browser will connect to the default port number 80 of the host www.nowhere123.com. You need to explicitly specify the port number in the URL, e.g. `http://www.nowhere123.com:8000/docs/index.html` if the server is listening at port 8000 and not the default port 80.

In brief, to communicate over **TCP/IP**, you need to know (a) **IP address** or **hostname**, (b) **Port number**.

## HTTP Specifications.
The HTTP specification is maintained by [W3C (World-wide Web Consortium)](http://www.w3.org/) and available at [http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/http](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/http).  There are currently two versions of HTTP, namely, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

## HTTP Request and Response Messages.
* HTTP client and server communicates by sending text messages. The client sends a *request message* to the server. The server, in turn, returns a *response message*.
* An HTTP message consists of a *message header* and an optional *message body*, seperated by a *blank* line, as shown below:

## HTTP Request Message.
The format of an HTTP request message is as follows:

![pic](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/images/HTTP_RequestMessage.png)

### Request Line
The first line of the header is called the request line, followed by optional request headers.
The request line has the following syntax:

```
request-method-name request-URI HTTP-version
```

* **request-method-name**: HTTP protocol defines a set of request methods, e.g, GET, POST, HEAD, and OPTIONS. The client can use one of these methods to send a request to the server.
* **request-URI**: specifies the resource requested.
* **HTTP-version**: Two versions are currently in use: HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1

Examples of request line are:
```
GET /test.html HTTP/1.1
HEAD /query.html HTTP/1.0
POST /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

### Request Headers.
The request headers are in the form of name:value pairs. Multiple values, seperated by commas, can be specified.

```
request-header-name: request-header-value1, request-header-value2, ....
```

Examples of request headers are:
```
Host: www.xyz.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Accept-Language: us-en, fr, cn
```

Example
The below shows a sample HTTP request message:

-----
## HTTP Response Message.
The format of the HTTP response message is as follows:

![pic](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/images/HTTP_ResponseMessage.png)

### Status Line.
The first line is called the *status* line, followed by optional response header(s).
The status line has the following syntax:

```
HTTP-version status-code reason-phrase
```

* **HTTP-version**: The HTTP version used in this session. Either HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
* **status-code**: a 3-digit number generated by the server to reflect the outcome of the request.
* **reason-phrase**: gives a short explaination to the status code.
* Common status code and reason phrase are "200 OK", "404 Not Found", "403 Forbidden", "500 Internal Server Error".

Examples of status line are:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

### Response Headers.
* The response headers are in the form name:value pairs:

```
response-header-name: response-header-value1, response-header-value2, ...
```

Examples of response headers are:

```
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 35
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
```
The response message body contains the resource data requested.

### Example.
